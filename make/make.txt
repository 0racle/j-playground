how to build/test j32/64/j64nonavx for linux/darwin/raspberry/...

$jplatform (set by jvars.sh) determines compiler/link flags

$jplatform is a simple name that implies OS and hardware

linux     implies intel
darwin    implies intel
raspberry implies linux/arm

# commands are assumed to run in ~ and depend on jvars.sh

# make sure shell scripts are executable
chmod +x git/jsource/make/*.sh

# copy jvars.sh to ~ (for finding things)
cp git/jsource/make/jvars.sh .
cat jvars.sh

# read jvars.sh and edit as appropriate - other steps depend on jvars.sh

# ensure proper jsrc/jversion.h (jversion-x.h template)

# create jbld folder (if not already created) and build binaries
. jvars.sh
$jmake/build_all.sh

# test j64 ($j64nonavx or $j32)
. jvars.sh
$j64

# the above are build steps for standard binaries

# the following steps are for building specific ones
# !!! makefiles do not have h file dependencies !!!
# after h file changes, run clean.sh to rm all *.o fles
$jmake/clean.sh

# build j64 binaries
$jmake/build_jconsole.sh j64
$jmake/build_libj.sh     j64
$jmake/build_tsdll.sh    j64

# build/test j32 j64nonavx binaries the same way (j32 or j64nonavx)
