examples assume ~/gitdev/jsource and builds in ~/jbld

put jsource anywhere (adjust examples etc.)
put jbld anywhere for non-windows, but it is hardwired in windows

start with latest jsource!
cd ~
cd gitdev/jsource
git clone or pull

jsrc/jversion.h   is not in repo
jsrc/jversion-x.h is in repo and is a template
copy jversion-x.h to jversion.h and edit this local copy as appropriate

read license.txt and note that the jsource folder can be used under
either a Jsoftware commercial license or under the GPL3 license.

unix:    read make/make.txt
windows: read makevs/makevs.txt

be sure you can do a clean build on a supported platform
before trying to add a new platform or make source changes

currently supported platforms are: windows, linux, darwin, raspberry, android

jversion.h defines are in the 9!:14'' result - edit as appropriate
it is in .gitignore so your local changes are not pushed to the repo
